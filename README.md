## üñãÔ∏è Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the ratings of restaurants using machine learning models. The goal is to provide a tool that helps restaurant owners or potential customers understand the factors influencing a restaurant's rating.

**Key Objectives:**
- Understand the factors that impact restaurant ratings.
- Build and evaluate predictive models to estimate ratings accurately.
- Gain actionable insights for improving restaurant performance.

---

## üîÑ Project Workflow

1. **Ingest:** 
   - Gather data from restaurant review platforms, including features like restaurant name, location, average cost, type of cuisine, and customer reviews.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
   - Analyze and visualize data to uncover trends, outliers, and correlations.
3. **Modeling:**
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.
4. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize findings, performance metrics, and potential business implications.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following key features:
- **Restaurant Name:** Name of the restaurant.
- **Cuisine Type:** Types of cuisine served (e.g., Indian, Italian, Chinese).
- **Average Cost:** Approximate cost for two people.
- **Location:** Geographical area where the restaurant is located.
- **Customer Reviews:** Text reviews from customers.
- **Rating:** The target variable representing the overall rating (e.g., 4.5/5).

### **Source**
Data was sourced from publicly available restaurant review platforms or synthetic data generation tools.

---

## üíª Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

### **Languages:**
- Python

### **Libraries:**
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling and evaluation)

### **Others:**
- Vscode/Jupyter notebook
- Git/GitHub (Version control and collaboration)

## üß† Modeling Approach

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
   - Use StandardScaler to scale the numeric variables.


2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Select the relevant features.
   - Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Experimented with the following algorithms:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Used metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared** to evaluate model performance.
   - Performed cross-validation to ensure robustness.

---

## üèÜ Results

- The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance with:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.088
  - **R-squared:** 0.96

- **Insights:**
  - Cuisine type and location were the most significant predictors of ratings.
  - Sentiment analysis on customer reviews added value to predictions.

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- **Data Enrichment:**
  - Include more features like restaurant ambiance, staff friendliness, or delivery speed.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques:**
  - Use transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for deeper analysis of customer reviews.
- **Real-Time Predictions:**
  - Deploy the model as an API for live predictions.
- **Integration with Maps:**
  - Combine predictions with location data for personalized restaurant recommendations.
